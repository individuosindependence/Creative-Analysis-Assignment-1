													<h3>Implied Roles</h3>
												</header>
												<p>As Judith Lorber states in her piece "'Night to His Day': The Social Construction of Gender" (1994), ‚Äú‚Ä¶gender is one of the major ways that human beings organize their lives‚Äù (2). Starting at birth, gender determines many aspects of a person's daily life, such as the way they dress, what they‚Äôre allowed to play with, and who they‚Äôre allowed to talk to. Later, these gender roles evolve into more important and impactful responsibilities which determine much of what you are supposed to do with your life. An example of this is the common trope in which women are submissive housewives while men are the dominant head of the family and the sole breadwinners. This oppressive system is called patriarchy.</p>

													<h3>Patriarchy and Exploitation</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Patriarchy is a social construct which dictates that men are superior to women in most aspects and are therefore supposed to take lead in most important roles of society. Religion is also used to ‚Äúprove‚Äù this to be fact by assuming that God made men to be this way, and this is, in fact, the natural order of all animal societies. This is simply not true, though, and can be disproven if we look at other societies.</p>
												<p>Sara Evans notes in her piece "The First American Women" (2011) that back when the fur trade was booming, fur traders, who ‚Äúwere almost exclusively male‚Äù, often greatly depended on the assistance of Native American women to survive (33). These women would hunt for food and serve it to the fur traders they accompanied, they would build the canoes they used to travel, they would even serve as interpreters for these men. They were undoubtedly a crucial part of the business. Yet, ‚Äútraders were notorious for abandoning wives of many years‚Ä¶‚Äù (Evans 2011, 33). No matter everything these women did to help these men succeed in their trade, they were still easily discarded as if they never represented any worth.</p>
												<p>The idea of a certain gender being superior to another is ridiculous, as, in the writing we just observed, women conducted most of the operations the men were supposed to do, according to a patriarchal system. Furthermore, when observing Native American societies prior to colonization, we can see that ‚ÄúIroquois women represented the apex of female political power. The land was theirs ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Evans 2011, 32). From having control over the distribution of food to being able to demote chiefs to lower ranks, women could hold much more responsibility than patriarchy states they can have.</p>

											<h3>Friendly Fire</h3>

										<p>It is pretty apparent that gender is nothing more than a social construct made up by a certain group of people who wanted to maintain superiority over another group. Even then, members of the male gender are subject to oppression and discrimination from other males. Click below to read more about this üëá.</p>
