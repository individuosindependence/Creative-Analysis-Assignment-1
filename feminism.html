											<h3>What is <strong>Feminism</strong>?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Feminism is a social movement which aims to bring down the system of oppression known as patriarchy to end the sexist exploitation brought upon any gender and peoples. As explained by Bell Hooks in her book ‚ÄúFeminism is for Everybody‚Äù (2000), this is by no means a movement against men (15), rather, a movement brought together by people of all genders to escape the confines of the roles their gender identity brings with them. It is the freedom for women to strive to be independent in their success, for nonbinary people to not be the subject of endless questioning and ridicule, for men to be able to be the househusbands and take care of their family in a different way, and for any identity of gender to be freely expressed and accepted.</p>
										<p>In the United States, there have been about four major waves of feminist movements:</p>
										<h3>First Wave (late 19th century - early 20th century)</h3>
										<p>This wave fought against many legal inequalities women faced at the time (particularly white women of the middle class). This includes the right to vote, access to employment, access to an education, and many more things. Because of this wave, in 1920, the 19th Amendment was passed, and white women gained the legal right to vote. Many issues women of color faced were not properly addressed within this wave.</p>
										<h3>Second Wave (1960‚Äôs ‚Äì 1980‚Äôs)</h3>
										<p>This wave brought focus to a wider range of issues, including discrimination in workplaces, reproductive rights, more legal inequalities, domestic violence, and marital rape. Out of this wave came the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, Title IX in 1972, and Roe v. Wade in 1973. The Equal Pay Act makes it illegal to discriminate women with paychecks of lesser amounts compared to the ones men receive for the same labor. Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination an assault within educational institutions. Roe v. Wade legalized abortions.</p>
										<h3>Third Wave (1990‚Äôs ‚Äì Early 2000‚Äôs)</h3>
										<p>This wave began to broaden the scope of victims under patriarchy from white middle class women to other people of different race, class, and sexuality. This movement also focused on bringing light to the fact that different forms of oppression are intertwined with each other. To fight back oppression, all forms must be addressed. Out of this movement, feminism boomed into common media and greater awareness was spread for people of marginalized groups. Issues of sexual harassment and/or assault were also brought into greater focus out of this wave.</p>
										<h3>Fourth Wave (2010‚Äôs ‚Äì Present)</h3>
										<p>This wave is characterized by digital activism. Social media is used to address issues such as sexual harassment and gender violence. It continues the previous wave‚Äôs focus of intersectionality between different groups of marginalized people. An example of an achievement that comes out of this current wave is the #MeToo movement.</p>
										<p>As we can see, each wave builds upon the previous waves and the feminist movement is continuously evolving. What we need to focus on today is solidarity between the oppressed, no matter how different we are from one another.</p>
										<p>The book ‚ÄúFeminism: A Very Short Introduction‚Äù by Margaret Walters (2005) excellently explains these concepts in more depth.</p>
