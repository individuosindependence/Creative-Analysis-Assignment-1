													<h3>Male or Female... or Neither?</h3>
												</header>
												<p>People who fail to adhere to the gender binary, regardless of sex, were also subject to inhumane treatment. This can be exhibited with the case of T Hall, a person who was born with both male and female identifiable genitalia. T was able to choose between two different identities: Thomas or Thomasine. According to Mary Beth Norton‚Äôs recounting in ‚Äú'Searchers again Assembled': Gender Distinctions in Seventeenth-Century America" (2011), ‚ÄúAs Thoman, Hall joined the army and emigrated to the colonies; as Thomasine, Hall lived quietly in London with an aunt, did fancy needlework in Plymouth, and presumably performed tasks normally assigned to women in Virginia‚Äù (68). When people found out about T‚Äôs unique identity, outrage broke out.</p>
												<p>Various searches and examinations of T‚Äôs genitalia were conducted by a group of men and another group of women. Neither gender group wanted to claim T as one of their own. Women claimed T to be a man because of their genitalia, while men claimed T to be a woman because of all the womanly activities they‚Äôd normally do. It was ultimately decided by the court that T was not a man because T could not have erections and was unable to impregnate a woman. In other words, ‚Äúany inferior man ‚Äì that is, one who could not function adequately in sexual terms ‚Äì was a woman‚Äù (69).</p>
												<p>The decision sparked an outrage from the women in the community and they once again argued about T‚Äôs gender identity, ultimately ruling that T must dress in both female and male clothing and thus excluding T into the ‚Äúother‚Äù role. Instead of being confined to either gender binary role, T was excluded and ostracized in their own role, one that failed to serve any meaningful purpose under patriarchy, and ‚Äúlike other publicly marked deviants [‚Ä¶] was perhaps the target of insults or assaults‚Äù (69).</p>

													<h3>Baby X: Animated Short Film</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The video above presents a case like that of T Hall‚Äôs in a shorter, animated format. It shows the ridiculous extent to which society will take gender as parents at a local school become outraged at the confusion X‚Äôs nonbinary identity brings them. This goes to show that even people of all ages, from kids to adults, can experience this form of oppression.</p>

													<h3>Male on Male Oppression</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Patriarchy does not let males stray from their assigned identities. Although they have certain privileges over women, those can easily be stripped away if one is deemed to be a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù of a man. We can see this happen to gay men, for example. According to Suzanne Pharr in her piece "The Common Elements of Oppression" (1997), gay men (and lesbian women) were likely to be targets of police harassment and even able to be denied protection by the same police when assaulted. Along with that, those of them who wished to be parents were commonly denied custody. Others were denied certain job opportunities, such as teaching. All this comes together and unfortunately ‚Äúcreates a climate in which it is permissible to act out physical violence towards lesbian and gay people‚Äù (56).</p>
