											<h3>Sex</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Sex is the medical identification of a person within the gender binary of male or female. Humans aren‚Äôt always bound to these two definitions, though, as some people are born with even both male and female genitalia and are therefore sometimes defined as ‚Äúother‚Äù, although that is not always the case (more information <a href="shared-struggles.html">here</a>). This is based more on surface level identification rather than personal and doesn't necessarily describe who someone is.</p>

											<h3>Gender Identity</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Gender identity is the gender someone personally defines themselves as. This is independent from sex and does not always adhere to the gender binary. Transgender is an umbrella term used to describe people who have a gender identity that differs from the one they were assigned at birth. People do not have to assimilate to gender associated roles in order to maintain their gender identity.</p>

											<h3>Sexuality</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Sexuality is another crucial part of human identity that describes the romantic/sexual attraction one has towards different gender identities. This, like gender identity, is unique for every person and can be fluid.</p>

											<h3>Gender Binary</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Gender binary is a term that is used to describe male and female gender identities. This is usually thought of as the norm in American society which implies that each gender impacts behavior, meaning that each gender is meant to carry out certain roles. For example, it is commonly thought that women are supposed to have children and be housewives while men must be the sole breadwinners of a family.</p>
